# Wordpress starter theme

Just a simple theme to start with when creating smaller custom WP solutions. Bigger frameworks are bloated and opinionated. Almost any solution can be implemented easely with a combination of plugins and Wordpress's own functionality.

The code is a mix of Wordpress' twentyninenteen, css-tricks and my own preferrences over time. 

## TODO

1. Upgrade out of the box SCSS
2. Upgradeout of the box WP setup (Customizer API, Gutenberg setup etc..)
